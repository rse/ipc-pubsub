About
-----

This [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module provides an
abstraction layer for [Inter-Process-Communication
(IPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication)
through Publish-Subscribe communication. It supports the following modes
(in order of increasing process scope and overall complexity):

- **Single-Process-Model (SPM):**<br/>
  This is for Node applications NOT using the Node.js
  [`cluster`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module.
  The communication is performed with an in-memory
  [`PatternEmitter`](http://npmjs.com/pattern-emitter). No external
  resource is needed.

- **Multi-Process-Model (MPM):**<br/>
  This is for Node applications using the Node.js
  [`cluster`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module. Hence, it is
  for Node applications split into distinct (related) processes, running
  on the same machine. The communication is performed with an in-memory
  [`PatternEmitter`](http://npmjs.com/pattern-emitter) in each process
  and an IPC message exchange between the processes with the help of the
  Node.js [`cluster`](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module. No
  external resource is needed.

- **Remote-Process-Model (RPM):**<br/>
  This is for Node applications split into (unrelated)
  distinct processes, usually running on distinct machines.
  The communication is performed with the help of an
  external broker. Currently a [NATS](https://nats.io/)
  broker (e.g. [gNATSd](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd)),
  a [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) broker (e.g.
  [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)), [Redis](https://redis.io/)
  [Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub)
  or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  [LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-listen.html) /
  [NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html)
  is supported.

Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install ipc-pubsub --save-dev
```

Usage
-----

```js
(async () => {
    const PubSub = require("ipc-pubsub")

    /*  open connection  */
    let pubsub = new PubSub("spm")
    await pubsub.open()

    /*  subscribe for messages  */
    await pubsub.subscribe("foo/#", (value, channel) => {
        console.log(value, channel) // -> "quux" "foo/bar"
    })

    /*  publish message  */
    await pubsub.publish("foo/bar", "quux")

    /*  close connection  */
    await pubsub.close()
})()
```

The following URLs are supported on `new PubSub(url)`:

- `spm:<id>`
- `mpm:<id>`
- `rpm+redis://[xxx:<secret>@]<host>[:<port>][/<id>]`
- `rpm+mqtt://[<username>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>][/<id>][?tls=true[&&key=<file>&&crt=<file>&&ca=<file>]]`
- `rpm+nats://[<username>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>][/<id>][?tls=true[&&key=<file>&&crt=<file>&&ca=<file>]]`
- `rpm+pgsql://[<username>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>][/<id>][?tls=true[&&key=<file>&&crt=<file>&&ca=<file>]]`

The `<id>` is an arbitrary unique identifier matching the regular expression `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*$`.

The channel names are MQTT-style topic names, i.e., slash-separated strings
like `foo/bar/quux`. The channel argument of `subscribe(channel, ...)`
is actually an MQTT-style topic pattern, i.e., it can contain `*` for single
element and `#` for remaining elements. For example: `foo/bar/*/quux/#`
will match `foo/bar/baz/quux/foo`. The only exception is the PostgreSQL
mechanism: it does not support any MQTT-style wildcards at all.

Recommendation: As Redis does not support TLS and PostgreSQL does not support
MQTT-style wildcards, we prefer to use IPC-PubSub primarily with MQTT and
[Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) or NATS and [gNATSd](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd).

Application Programming Interface (API)
---------------------------------------

```ts
interface PubSubSubscription {
    unsubscribe(): Promise<void>;
}

declare class PubSub {
    constructor(url: string);

    open(): Promise<void>;

    publish(
        channel: string,
        message: any
    ): Promise<void>;

    subscribe(
        channelPattern: string,
        onMessage: (message: any, channel: string) => void
    ): Promise<PubSubSubscription>;

    close(): Promise<void>;
}
```
